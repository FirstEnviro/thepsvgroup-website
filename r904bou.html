      <h2 class="pb-2 border-bottom">History</h2>
      <p>R904 BOU was new to First Badgerline in 1998 as part of a batch of nineteen identical vehicles, R901-910, 912-919 BOU, and R920 COU. These were split between Bath and Wells depots, for routes X39 and 173/376/377 respectively. Sporting Wright Renown bodywork on the capable Volvo B10BLE chassis, these vehicles were specified with 47 seats (most fitted with headrests), double glazing, air chill system, low entry, and fold up seats to help accommodate wheelchair users and buggies. As was standard for most FirstGroup vehicles of the period, destination displays were in the form of Hanover flipdot route number displays, and traditional rollerblind destinations. All were delivered in First’s Barbie livery, with Barbie interior trim and fittings, but grey seat backs and legs, in contrast with the usual purple used. </p>
      <p>1904 was allocated to Wells depot, and spent the first six years of life on countryside routes between England's smallest city, and nearby Bath and Bristol. In 2004, the arrival of new Wright Eclipse Urban bodied Volvo B7RLEs for the same routes saw off a number of the Renowns, with 1904, now numbered 66104 in First’s five digit national numbering system, transferring to Bristol’s Lawrence Hill depot. The rest of 1904’s life as a PSV was spent here, confined mostly to city routes, but also venturing into South Gloucestershire, and back into North Somerset on the various X routes. </p>
      <p>In the late 2000s, the members of the batch that remained in the south were treated to a fairly extensive refurbishment, consisting of a full repaint into Barbie 3 livery, retrim in the then-new moquette, and fitment of LED destination screens all round. This would see most of the fleet through the rest of their working lives. However, in late 2014, 66104 was involved in a fairly minor front end collision, for the second time, and received a new front dome, as well as a full repanel and repaint into the new First Urban scheme. Two others were so treated in Bristol, 66110 and 66117, as well as West Yorkshire’s 66101 and South Yorkshire (Rotherham) paint float 66112, which also had extensive interior changes to comply with PSVAR regulations. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container px-4 py-5">
      <h2 class="pb-2 border-bottom">In Preservation</h2>
      <p>66104 was withdrawn in December 2015, and was then modified to serve as a driver training vehicle, with the cab door and both front bulkheads removed, repeater lights fitted inside, and a second handbrake and instructors seat installed on a plinth in the gangway. A few changes to the seating layout were also made, which involved removing all of the tip up seats, and a couple of rows further back. This was only a temporary reprieve, being sold to Mundens (Bristol Bus and Coach Sales), before ending up with Truck School, where it gained a mid blue half repaint over the First livery, as well as extensive graphics. In 2019, it was again sold, this time to  WTTS, where the silver was added over parts of the previous blue repaint. It didn’t last long in the role here, and it wasn’t long before I received the email confirming a sale, and the necessary arrangements were made to collect 1904 in early 2020. </p>
      <p>Since then, significant work has been undertaken to get the interior closer to its original state, with the cab bulkhead and nearside glass refitted, tip up seats sourced, missing seats replaced, removed grab rails salvaged, and original destination cowlings and mountings (removed when the LED displays were fitted) recovered from various scrap vehicles. Unnecessary clutter was also removed from the cab area, and an original style tacho fitted. As a result, the layout inside is looking much more familiar now.</p>

    <div class="container px-4 py-5">
      <h2 class="pb-2 border-bottom">Future Plans</h2>
      <p>Unfortunately, work has stalled somewhat after the gearbox failed, necessitating complete replacement, or removal and rebuild. Once this is completed, it is hoped that further restoration will continue, with a view to a full repaint to original condition, replacement of rotten flooring and damaged lino, and retrim and repadding of the now very tired seats, along with refitting all the original trim, fittings, and lights that have been replaced and damaged over the years. </p>
